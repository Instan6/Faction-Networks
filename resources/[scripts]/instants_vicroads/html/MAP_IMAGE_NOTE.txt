MAP IMAGE SIZE ISSUE
=====================

The gtav_map.png file (21MB, 6144x9216px) is too large for NUI to load properly.

TO FIX:
-------
1. Reduce the image size using an image editor (Photoshop, GIMP, etc.)
   - Recommended size: 2048x3072 pixels or smaller
   - Save as PNG or JPG with 75-85% quality
   - Target file size: under 5MB

2. Replace the current gtav_map.png with the optimized version

3. Restart the resource: ensure vn_vicroads

ALTERNATIVE:
------------
The current styled fallback map works perfectly and shows:
- Clean dark blue gradient background
- Grid overlay with compass directions
- All office location markers
- Player position marker
- Full drag and zoom functionality

To keep using the fallback (recommended), set the texture path to null in:
resources/[scripts]/vn_vicroads/client/main.lua
Line ~180: cb({ texture = nil })
